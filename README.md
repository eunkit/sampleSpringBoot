# Problem Statement


The problem we're trying to solve here is
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction,plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
Calculate the points earned per month by a customer
